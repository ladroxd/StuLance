- Added Django i18n with `EN`, `FR`, and `AR` translations
- RTL layout support for Arabic using Bootstrap RTL
- Language switcher in navbar

## Phase 9 — Database Migration (SQLite → MySQL)

---

## Phase 11 — Performance & Notification Dropdown
**Commits: `1a8e511` → `9dd676e` — 2026-05-04**

### Performance Fixes
- Added `CONN_MAX_AGE: 60` to MySQL config — reuses DB connections instead of opening a new TCP connection per request (eliminated 100–300ms per page load)
- Added `dns-prefetch` hints for Bootstrap, Google Fonts CDNs — browser resolves DNS earlier, reducing first-paint delay
- Disabled `use_google_fonts_cdn` in Jazzmin — removed redundant CDN request on admin pages
- Documented: always use `run_local.bat` for dev to avoid Railway DB network latency

### Notification Bell Dropdown
- Converted navbar bell icon from plain link to Bootstrap dropdown
- Dropdown shows last 5 notifications with icon, title, message preview, and unread dot indicator
- Notifications preloaded on page load — instant display on first click (no wait)
- Badge and dropdown content refresh every 30 seconds automatically
- "Mark all read" link and "See all notifications" button at bottom of dropdown
- Fixed Vite closure scoping issue — notification logic moved to inline script in `base.html`
- New JSON endpoint: `GET /notifications/recent/` returns last 5 notifications + unread count

---

## Phase 10 — CDC Gap Analysis & Feature Completion
**Commit: `eec5020` — 2026-05-04**

### CDC Compliance Review

### Student Dashboard — Earnings ("Mes Gains")
- Added total earnings calculation: sum of `budget` across all completed missions where the student was selected
- Displayed as a green gradient earnings banner (in MAD) below the stat cards
- Added **Mission History** section listing all completed missions with date and budget

### Admin Statistics Page (`/dashboard/admin/stats/`)
- New staff-only page with platform-wide metrics:
  - Total students, recruiters, verified students, pending verifications
  - Mission breakdown: open / in progress / completed / total
  - Total applications, average platform rating, total value of completed missions (MAD)
  - Top 5 categories by mission count
- Linked from the navbar dropdown for staff users under "Statistics"

### Report / Flag System
- New `Report` model with: reporter, target (mission or user profile), reason, description, status (pending / reviewed / dismissed)
- Duplicate report prevention per reporter/target pair
- **Report a mission** button on mission detail page (hidden from mission owner)
- **Report a profile** button on student public profile page (hidden from own profile)
- Shared `report_form.html` with radio reason selector (spam / inappropriate / fake / other) and optional description
